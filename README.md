# NeonRunner

A neon-themed First Person View (FPV) runner with some chill synthwave beat. It's all about creating a groovy feel as you slip and slide your way through a sci-fi obstacle course.

I made the game for an assignment as part of the Computer Graphics course at BITS Pilani (IS F311).

## Build and play

The game has been created on Unity 2019.3.0f1 and is sure to work on that version. Just clone this repo and open it as a Unity project.
